Chapter 6, Question 26

Edsger Dijkstra introduced the Sleeping Barber Problem (Dijkstra, 1965): A
barbershop is divided into two rooms. The waiting room has n chairs, and the
work room only has the barber chair. When the waiting room is empty, the
barber goes to sleep in the barber chair. If a customer comes in and the barber
is asleep, he knows itâ€™s his turn to get his hair cut. So he wakes up the barber
and takes his turn in the barber chair. But if the waiting room is not empty, the
customer must take a seat in the waiting room and wait his turn. Write a program
that will coordinate the barber and his customers.
